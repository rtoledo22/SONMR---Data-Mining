SONMR is a data mining algorithm used to sort itemsets, where separate processors classify and tally certain combinations of items within itemsets at a parallel pace. An example of this is within an array of [1, 2, 3]. In this itemset, a SONMR algorithm will record the following combinations: (1), (2), (3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2, 3). Combinations that are reversed or have the same items (i.e. (2, 1) or (3, 1, 2)) are counted toward the same combination. Different itemsets are run through different processors using map and reduce functions as to lower the processing time it takes for larger sets of data.
